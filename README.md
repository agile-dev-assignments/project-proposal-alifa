#### Project idea with Adam Ethan

# Project Title: Movie Critic

## What and Why?
Movie Critic is a web app that is customized for audiences. The website will average user/audience reviews by using data collected from sites like IMDB, and google movie reviews, to create an average audience score. Critic scores will also be collected from websites like Yahoo! Movies, Roger Ebert, etc, to generate a critic score. Along with the audience scores and the critic scores, users of the website will also contribute to the score or the movie. Aggregating data from various sources will allow users to get a more accurate representation of a film of their choice.

Users can also search for movies based on their interests and likings that are indicated on their profile. Possibly, the app can generate/recommend movies based on user specifications. 

### Software
This project can be built using JavaScript, Express, and Node.js

## For Whom?
This web app will be open for public use. It is catered toward an average individual who is not a movie expert (so no movie critic). 

## How?
From the user's perspective:
- A user can search for a movie that they are interested in watching. Upon clicking on the title, three scores will appear, the audience score, critic score, and Movie Critic user score. Using three of these scores, an average will be taken to create a final score of the movie. 

- A user can log in to the website and leave scores for movies and build a profile. The profile can contain interests, preferred genres, movies they like. A potential feature of the site is to have a movie recommendation generator, that will recommend a movie based on previously watched movies and/or genres.

  ### Technologies
  This project can be built using JavaScript, Express, and Node.js
  Passport can be used for authentication and login specifications

## Scope 
This project is ideal for a team of 4-6 people, as it has many elements to it. The project can be broken into pieces that require different skillsets, which will allow each team member to contribute a sufficient amount. There is a sufficient amount of both front-end, and backend work needed for this project. The project is also very flexible. New features and add-ons can be discussed and implemented if needed.
